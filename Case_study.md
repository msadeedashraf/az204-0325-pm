## Case Study 2: Serverless Backend using Azure Functions and Azure Storage Queues

**Scenario:**  
You‚Äôre building a backend process to resize uploaded images. When a user uploads an image, it should be processed in the background.

**Azure Services:**  
- Azure Function (Queue Trigger)  
- Azure Blob Storage  
- Azure Storage Queue  

**Requirements:**  
- When an image is uploaded, add a message to the queue.

**Implementation Steps:**  
1. Create a Storage Account with 2 Blob Containers (original and resized).  
2. Add a Queue to the Storage Account.  
3. Write an Azure Function that is triggered by a new message in the queue.  
4. The function reads the blob, resizes the image, and writes it to the resized container.  
5. Log function execution to Application Insights.  

**Learning Goals:**  
- Use serverless compute effectively.  
- Handle blob and queue storage.  
- Implement scalable background jobs.

- Use Managed Identity to access secrets.  

**Implementation Steps:**  
1. Write an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger for payment processing.  
2. Store the third-party API key in Azure Key Vault.  
3. Assign a system-managed identity to the function.  
4. Access Key Vault secrets using Azure SDK.  
5. Log all transactions securely using Application Insights.  

**Learning Goals:**  
- Secure secrets with Key Vault.  
- Access secrets using managed identity.  
- Design stateless, secure APIs.

**Scenario:**  
You are building an online learning platform that needs to scale based on usage.

**Azure Services:**  
- Azure App Service  
- Azure SQL Database  
- Azure Monitor  
- Azure Auto Scale  

**Requirements:**  
- Host the platform using Azure Web App.  
- Use Azure SQL to manage course data.  
- Automatically scale based on CPU usage.  
- Monitor application health.  

**Implementation Steps:**  
1. Deploy the Web App in a Standard App Service Plan.  
2. Configure Auto Scale rules based on CPU and request count.  
3. Set up Azure Monitor to collect logs and performance data.  
4. Add alerts and dashboards to track anomalies.  
5. Enable diagnostic logging for HTTP requests and errors.  

**Learning Goals:**  
- Design for scalability.  
- Monitor applications in real time.  
- Implement cost-efficient scaling strategies.
